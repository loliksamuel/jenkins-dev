# jenkins-pipeline-workshop - get ready for the workshop

## purpose
Getting up and running with a simple setup of Jenkins which will enable us to develop pipelines and pipeline libraries.
Workshop participants should come with this setup up and running on their laptops, so we can focus on `pipeline` it's different features / options.


## Method
Instead of explaining all the things related to a Jenkins setup (plugins mainly), we will be using a paradigm `Jenkins` supports which is basically using a bunch of groovy scripts to setup our environment.
My bloody Jenkins us written in
In order to be able to learn the pipeline we assume you will have a:
1. Jenkins instance,
2. A git repository with a Dockerfile
3. An ECR / DockerHub account so we can push the image there once were done ...

## My Bloody Jenkins - and opinionated (exactly what we need ...) setup
This example will:
1. setup a Jenkins instance
2. Configure it via a config.yaml file
3. Setup Docker as a `build cloud provider` to Jenkins
3. Instantiate a seed job

## Pre-requirements
1. git (cli installed on laptop)
1. A GitHub account
1. Docker (cli installed on laptop and run as daemon or connected to remote Docker server)
1. docker-compose (cli installed on laptop)
1. A Docker hub account (https://hub.docker.com/)
1. A local clone of this repository (for the template files in it), which will be your workspace for this workshop.
1. A [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) clone of the https://github.com/shelleg/jenkins-pipeline-workshop-library repository.
1. A [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) clone of the https://github.com/shelleg/docker-gitbook repository.

## Setup steps

#### 1. Copy the `config.yml.template` to `config.yml` inside your local repository workspace
``` cp config.yml.template config.yml ```

#### 2. prepare a git account with a private ssh-key and add it to the credentials section in `config.yml`
```
gitsshkey:
  type: sshkey
  description: gitsshkey
  username: < github username >
  passphrase: < your ssh key passphrase if no empty >
  privatekey: |
    -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    your ssh should be here, with all lines idented to the left as this line is ...
```
#### 3. prepare a docker hub account credentials and add it to the credentials section in `config.yml`
```
dockerHub:
  type: userpass
  username: <dockerhub username>
  password: <dockerhub password>
```

#### 4. fork the docker-gitbook repository and set the config.yml to use it instead of the original docker-gitbook repository **
```
seed_jobs:
  gitbook-docker-jenkins-pipeline-workshop:
    source:
      remote: git@github.com:<github-user>/docker-gitbook.git
      branch: 'master'
      credentialsId: gitsshkey
    triggers:
      pollScm: '* * * * *'
    pipeline: jenkinsfile
    executeWhen: never
```

#### 5. fork the jenkins-pipeline-workshop-library repository and set the config.yml to use it instead of the original jenkins-pipeline-workshop-library repository **
```
pipeline_libraries:
  jenkins-pipeline-workshop-library:
    source:
      remote: git@github.com:<github-user>/jenkins-pipeline-workshop-library.git
      credentialsId: gitsshkey
    defaultVersion: master
    implicit: false
    allowVersionOverride: true
    includeInChangesets: true
```

#### 6. set environment variable named `HOST_IP`
```
export HOST_IP="$(ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | grep -Fv 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}' | head -n 1 | sed -e 's/addr://')"
```

#### 7. Copy the `docker-compose.yml.template` to `docker-compose.yml`
``` cp docker-compose.yml.template docker-compose.yml ```

#### 8. Start Jenkins

At this stage run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

Please note: if it's the first time running my bloody jenkins it will take time to download the image, + perform a reload to Jenkins.

#### 9. Browse to Jenkins and validate that build passed OK

Browse to http://localhost:8080 and login as 'admin' user (password is in the config.yml file).
After the server is loaded OK (after restart once for plugins update), a first build should start running.

Once done you should have something like the following:

#### 10. Once you're done with last step, you're ready for the workshop.

The main task in the workshop is to convert the simple Jenkins Pipeline to a Pipeline that uses a shared library with Steps and complete-flow class.




Jenkins-Docker Dev Env
======================

Purpose
-------

A simple docker-compose file which starts jenkins via Docker Compose.
The idea is to have a running jenkins locally for testing the current
setup creates a .jenkins_home (which is naturally in gitignore ...) so
you can revisit it on every developmen iteration in the same state.

![jenkins-docker](http://www.tothenew.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/627x302xdocker-jenkins.png.pagespeed.ic.rdLVquN8qf.png)

Usage
-----
Create a .env file with any Environment variable you might want to send
to Jenkins such as 'jenkins.install.runSetupWizard' which you can set to
false in order to skip the wizard - [A Full list
here](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Features+controlled+by+system+properties)


Todo
----
1. Add a set of default plugins to jenkins via plugins.txt file in the
container
2. Configure commomn usecases such as Shared library development and
   varios command line utils
3. Consider - push jenkins_home to GitLFS ?! / Custom jenkins-dev
   container with a specific set of plugins ? - TBD
